# Toolbox README

- [ ] TODO Replace or update this README with instructions relevant to your application

To start the application in development mode, import it into your IDE and run the `Application` class. 
You can also start the application from the command line by running: 

```bash
./mvnw
```

To build the application in production mode, run:

```bash
./mvnw -Pproduction package
```

To also build a Docker image, continue by running:

```bash
docker build -t my-application:latest .
```

## Getting Started

The [Getting Started](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/getting-started) guide will quickly familiarize you with your new
Toolbox implementation. You'll learn how to set up your development environment, understand the project 
structure, and find resources to help you add muscles to your skeleton — transforming it into a fully-featured 
application.

## Disabling the Login Screen

By default, all views in the project are restricted to *authenticated users*. This means that if you try to access any
view without being logged in, you'll be redirected to the login screen.

To make views publicly accessible, set the `loginRequired` property to `false` in the view's `config` object:

```tsx
export const config: ViewConfig = {
  // ...
  loginRequired: false,
};
```

For example, applying this change to `src/main/frontend/views/@index.tsx` allows you to open http://localhost:8080 
without logging in.

If you allow anonymous access to `src/main/frontend/views/task-list.tsx`, you’ll also need to update the method-level 
security annotations in `TaskService`. Without these changes, the view may load, but data fetching or saving will fail 
due to backend access restrictions.

## Removing Security

This project includes a basic, preconfigured security setup. If you prefer to implement your own security configuration
from scratch, follow these steps to remove the existing one:

- Delete the `security` Java package.
- Delete the `src/main/frontend/security` directory.
- Delete the `src/main/frontend/index.tsx` file.

After these changes, you may encounter some minor compilation errors in both Java and TypeScript. These typically occur
in places where the current security setup is referenced - for example, integration tests that run as specific users,
or UI components (like the main layout) that display the current user's name and avatar.

To resolve these issues, either remove the affected code or refactor it to align with your custom security setup.
